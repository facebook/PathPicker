USAGE_INTRO = '''
Welcome to fpp, the Facebook PathPicker! We hope your stay
with us is enjoyable.

To get started with fpp, pipe some kind of terminal output into the program.
Examples include:

    * git status | fpp
    * git show | fpp
    * git diff HEAD master | fpp
    * git diff HEAD~10 --numstat | fpp
    * grep -r "Banana" . | fpp
    * find . -iname "*.js" | fpp

Once fpp parses your input (and something that looks like a file matches), it
will put you inside a pager that will allow you to select files with the
following commands:
'''

USAGE_PAGE_HEADER = '''
== Navigation ==

'''

USAGE_PAGE = '''
    * [f] toggle the selection of a file
    * [A] toggle selection of all (unique) files
    * [down arrow|j] move downward by 1
    * [up arrow|k] move upward by 1
    * [<space>] page down
    * [b] page up

Once you have your files selected, you can
either open them in your favorite
text editor or execute commands with
them via command mode:

    * [<Enter>] open all selected files
        (or file under cursor if none selected)
        in $EDITOR
    * [c] enter command mode
'''

USAGE_COMMAND_HEADER = '''
== Command Mode ==

'''

USAGE_COMMAND = '''
Command mode is helpful when you want to
execute bash commands with the filenames
you have selected. By default the filenames
are appended automatically to command you
enter before it is executed, so all you have
to do is type the prefix. Some examples:

    * git add
    * git checkout HEAD~1 --
    * rm -rf

These commands get formatted into:
    * git add file1 file2 # etc
    * git checkout HEAD~1 -- file1 file2
    * rm -rf file1 file2 # etc

If your command needs filenames in the middle,
the token "$F" will be replaced with your
selected filenames if it is found in the command
string. Examples include:

    * scp $F dev:~/backup
    * mv $F ../over/here

Which format to:
    * scp file1 file2 dev:~/backup
    * mv file1 file2 ../over/here
'''

USAGE_CONFIGURATION = '''
== Configuration ==


PathPicker offers a bit of configuration currently with more to come
in the future.

~ Editor ~

The $FPP_EDITOR environment variable can be set to tell PathPicker
which editor to open the selected files with. If that variable
is not set, $EDITOR is used the next fallback, with "vim" as a last resort.

'''

USAGE_TAIL = '''
That's a fairly in-depth overview of Facebook PathPicker.
We also provide help along the way as you
use the app, so don't worry and jump on in!
